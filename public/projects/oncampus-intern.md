During my 5th semester, I decided to apply for a part-time position at Tecnologico de Monterrey that would accommodate my academic schedule. Fortunately, I secured a role that aligned well with my career path, which proved to be a valuable experience, particularly as it was my first formal employment position with monthly compensation.

My responsibilities included analyzing data from various assessments conducted by the Institute for the Future of Education on students from both within and outside Tecnologico de Monterrey. The primary objective was to identify patterns and explore correlations between different degree programs across various schools. Additionally, I developed neural networks using LSTM architecture for more complex tasks that required classifying students according to specific profiles.



**Due to Due to Tecnologico de Monterrey policy, I'm unable to share the full Jupyter Notebook of the models used but some of it can be seen in the video below.**
